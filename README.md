# Schedule-Abstraction Graph in Python

Schedule-abstraction graph (SAG) is a reachability-based response-time analysis for real-time systems.

This is the unofficial implementation of the SAG in Python. This is still WIP (Work-in-Progress). The implemented SAG follows the following paper:
- M. Nasri, G. Nelissen, and B. Brandenburg, “[Response-Time Analysis of Limited-Preemptive Parallel DAG Tasks under Global Scheduling](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol133-ecrts2019/LIPIcs.ECRTS.2019.21/LIPIcs.ECRTS.2019.21.pdf)”, Proceedings of the 31st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2019), pp. 21:1–21:23, July 2019.
